# Predictive-Analysis-of-Alcohol-Consumption-of-Portuguese-Students
This analysis aims to develop a predictive model for student weekend alcohol consumption ("Walc") based on attributes of secondary school students. Specifically, the primary research goal is to build a binary classification model to effectively predict whether students report low (1-2) or high (3-5) weekend drinking levels.

School counselors and administrators could utilize such a model to identify students more likely to engage in problematic drinking. Middle schools and high schools have the ability to implement highly effective programs to reduce youth alcohol consumption.<sup>1</sup> The priority would be detecting high-risk students, rather than focusing on overall accuracy equally. Underage and binge drinking brings greater health and safety concerns according to the CDC<sup>2</sup>, so minimizing false negatives is key for intervention.

At least five explanatory variables will be considered, encompassing: demographics like age and gender; family factors including quality of relationships ("famrel"); academic engagement through absences and extracurricular activities; and existing weekday drinking levels ("Dalc"). Both numerical and categorical inputs will be included.

Predictive performance on new datasets is the primary research goal. The secondary goals are developing reliable interpretability into variable relationships, as well as thorough descriptive analytics of the data.
